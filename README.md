## API Key
Google cloud API Key can be created from Google Cloud Console, after enabling billing. The key included here was used in testing and has been deleted. If you plan to use this code then you will need your own API Key.

## Description
If you need to check prayer times, then I have a page on this Github repository can help. It is also running at this link https://andromedabay.ddns.net/namaz.html. It is based on a Open Source JavaScript code published at PrayTimes.org. I would like to acknowledge the work done by the team at the original ParyTimes.Org (Mr. Hamid Zarrabi-Zadeh) website (http://www.praytimes.org), without whose work, my page would not have been possible.
